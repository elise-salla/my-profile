	<h3>Travelling</h3>
		<p>I have always loved travelling. I was lucky enough to live in 5 different countries giving me the opportunity to discover new cultures around these countries. These were the best year of my life.</p>

	<h4>Formula 1</h4>
		<p>I discovered Formula 1 recently but ever since have been a big fan, I enjoy watching the races on the weekend but also enjoy keeping up with the different teams and the strategies they put in place to make their cars better.</p>
